# Stream One Project - sea&stone

sea&stone is a fictional seafood restaurant based in West Cork. The website is a simple site for the restaurant with every detail one would want when choosing where to eat. 

## UX

For this site, I wanted the layout to be very clean and simple so I went for a simple colour scheme and a minimal layout. When I visit a restaurant or shop website, I am often frustrated trying to find where their open hours might be located or where I'd find their menu so I wanted the site to be straightforward and simple to follow. 

When a user visits the site for the first time, they are met with 3 simple images that already convey an idea of the type of food they can find at this restaurant, ie seafood. Below this, theres also a quick blurb about the restaurant to give the user a further idea of what its about.

The navbar then allows the user to follow a simple path to get what they need, be it menus, contact details, location etc. 

I drew up some brief ideas with pen and paper of how I wanted the site to look and then I created simple wireframes in Photoshop which can be found in the mockup folder on Github as well as a detailed [PDF](https://github.com/oheag2/projectone/blob/master/mockups/seaandstonemockup.pdf) about the site. 

## Features

Existing Features:

- Homepage:

The homepage is kept simple and clean, and just displays 3 simple images to convey the type of food found in sea&stone.

- About:

The about page gives some basic info on sea&stone, like opening hours and what type of food is served. 

- News:

The news page is like a blog page that can be updated easily, detailing news and upcoming events at sea&stone. It also includes some videos to give customers an idea of what the events are like, ie the barista master class and gives updates and info on upcoming events and event bookings. 

- Menus:

The menu page was initially created as a simple js carousel of all the menus available but this wasn't very eye catching so I amended it to have separate PDF menus for each meal type. These download to your device or open in new tabs. I also included a js carousel of eye catching food images to give users an idea of what type of food sea&stone provides.   

- Location: 

The location page includes an embedded Google map which can easily be used for directions to sea&stone as well as the address and info on parking nearby.

- Contact:

The contact page gives visitors the opportunity to fill in a form if they want to book an event like a Christmas party or family gathering. When the form is submitted, the user is shown a pop up to say 'thanks, we'll be in touch soon' to show that the form has been succesfully submitted. It also gives visitors all contact details like phone number and email address as well as links to the Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts for sea&stone. 

Features left to implement:

- Footer:

I think the site needs a proper footer at the bottom with links. 

- Something more:

I'm not sure what else restaurant websites really need but I'd like mine to be a bit more exciting and not quite so simple. It would be nice to have an external table booking system integrated like Open Table.

## General testing for responsiveness

The site was tested on phones, tablets, laptops and desktop pcs to ensure it was as responsive as possible and adjustments were then made to make sure it both looked and functioned well. Using Chromes developer tools, I was also able to check that it worked for screen dimensions of many sizes. I wanted the photos and items to stack when the site was viewed on a phone or smaller device but still look good with everything fitting correctly and not overflowing or being oversized. 

## Deployment

The site was regularly updated by pushing to Github which I then used to host the site.
